# Chatbot-with-DNLP
This chatbot is trained on cornell movie dialog corpus using LSTM with encoder, decoder and pre-processing parts explained.
Used tensorflow to build the LSTM RNN. Used Numpy, Pandas, Regular Expressions to load and pre-process the data.
Took reference and Inspiration from [here](http://suriyadeepan.github.io/2016-06-28-easy-seq2seq/) (This is based on twitter dataset) and @SuperDataScience Team.

I have documneted few parts of the code and will document it completely soon.


You can ask me anything! and I'm more than happy to help.
